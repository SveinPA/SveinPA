## Hi I'm Svein ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ’» Software Engineering student focused on building practical skills.

I'm a 2nd-year **Software Engineering student at NTNU Ã…lesund**, currently learning how to design and build sofware step by step.
Through my studies and projects, I'm gaining hands-on practice with:
* Writing clean and structured Java code (JavaFX, Spring Boot, Maven).
* Applying common **software design principles** to keep projects maintainable.
* Using **databases** and exploring backend development.
* Collaborating in teams using **SCRUM methodology**.
* Building a foundation in **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **network programming**.

Outside of school, I like experimenting with **homelab setups** (Proxmox, Docker, TrueNAS) and work on small personal projects to challenge myself.
